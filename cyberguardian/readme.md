# Cyber Guardian: An Educational Android-based 3D Cybersecurity RPG

## Description 
*Endorsed by STI College Caloocan's IT department as the Best Capstone for the ICTE Symposium & Colloqium of 2023-2024.* 

Cyber Guardian is a supplemental learning tool that promotes cybersecurity among (ICT) students, offering an engaging experience that emphasizes the importance of cyber-hygiene in today's rapidly evolving tech era.

Players will learn about the basics of cybersecurity and cyber-hygienic practices that will equip them with the know-how necessary to protect them from online attacks and threats. 

The key topics of the proposed game are: malwares, proper practices when navigating the internet, and data privacy and security. The gameplay takes inspiration from others, such as: “Kahoot” and “Pokémon”.

## Story
