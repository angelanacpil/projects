# A.C.E.: ONLINE APPOINTMENT SYSTEM WITH SMS TECHNOLOGY 

## Description 
A.C.E. (Appointment Creator and Editor) is an online appointment system utilizing SMS technology for a multi-specialty outpatient facility. 

The system delivers a digital solution to enhance the productive output of, and automate, clerical operations in the clinic. It offers a convenient interface in the clinic's operational environment, facilitating clearer communication among customers, clinical staff, and doctors by indicating availability, schedules, and the status of bookings. 

Self-service is also encouraged by design, permitting public entry to the website through user authentication, as well as automation in notifying patients.

## Technologies Used 
- ReactJS 
- Material-UI 
- ExpressJS 
- Supabase (w/PostgreSQL integration)
- ClickSend (SMS API) 

## Objectives  
1. Manage logs of appointments, patients, and doctors.
2. Allow patients to book for appointments.
3. Remind patients about their appointed medical sessions through SMS. 

The system authorizes two user roles: "admin" and "patient." The "admin" role is assigned to the owner or clinical staff with administrative privileges, while the "patient" role has limited permissions designated for customers.
